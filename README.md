- This code base provides a general sampling-based solver for numerical constraint satisfaction problems defined on directed acyclic graphs representative of function composition.
- The code is agnostic to the sampling scheme used, which may be customised by the user. By default a nested sampling scheme (DEUS) is used.
- The code exploits graph structure to improve the efficiency of solution identification.
